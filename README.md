<h3 align="center">Disaster and Emergency Aid Management Application</h3>
  <p>
    An application that manages the list of items needed to be shipped to an affected area when disaster strikes. 
  </p>

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
<p>
This application keeps track of the quantity of each item needed, the number of items on hand, the needed purchase fund, shipping the items and storing the data in a file for future use. Items are divided into categories of:

- Items (non-perishable products), such as blankets and tents, that have no expiry date
- Perishables, such as food and medicine, that have an expiry date

Through a CL menu, the comprehensive list items feature displays essential details such as SKU, description, quantity available, quantity needed, unit price, and expiry date for each product, as well as calculates the needed purchase fund for a given quantity.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project was designed to gain hands-on experience delving into the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and modular design by building a comprehensive solution to a scenario.

- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Developed a modular system using classes to encapsulate functionalities and ensure a clean, organized codebase.
- **Modular Programming:** Emphasized modular design, fostering code reusability and maintainability by creating independent components/different modules with low coupling and high cohesion.
- **Foundations and Types:** Strengthened C++ foundations, focusing on types, overloading, and references, while implementing dynamic memory allocation for resource management.
- **Encapsulation and Privacy:** Implemented data encapsulation within different classes, emphasizing the importance of information hiding and data privacy.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism:** Introduced class hierarchies, leveraging inheritance and polymorphism for code organization and extensibility.
- **Virtual Functions and Abstract Base Classes:** Explored the use of virtual functions and abstract base classes to define common interfaces and accommodate diverse implementations.
- **Templates:** Implemented generic programming with templates to enhance adaptability, allowing the system to handle various data types efficiently.
